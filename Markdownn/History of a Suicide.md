> In trying to understand why some people have the ability to endure intense despair while others succumb, I think of lines from Wallace Stevens’s “The Snow Man,” where he writes, One must have a mind of winter, And have been cold a long time To behold the junipers shagged with ice, The spruces rough in the distant glitter Of the January sun; and not to think Of any misery in the sound of the wind, In the sound of a few leaves, Which is the sound of the land. .

> Time had formed a seal over the tenderness of my emotions. But from time to time the seal cracked. Mourning the loss of a suicide is a different kind of grieving. It has little to do with the five stages of grief or with any known timetable. Grief is tangled up with complicated feelings of shame and stigma, unsettling feelings about the past, and guilt. Always guilt. It throws into question existential notions about God and the meaning of life itself. When something so terrible can happen, it makes us unsure of how much to trust what we think we know about another person.

> Young people who feel hopeless need help in solving problems and think their parents often don’t understand or are not involved enough to know the depth of their need. Objectively they do not have more problems than others, but they are less equipped to deal with them. People are able to tolerate depression as long as there is a feeling that things will improve. If that belief is shattered the only option may be suicide.
