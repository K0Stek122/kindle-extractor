> I once knew an Episcopalian lady in Newport, Rhode Island, who asked me to design and build a doghouse for her Great Dane. The lady claimed to understand God and His Ways of Working perfectly. She could not understand why anyone should be puzzled about what had been or about what was going to be. And yet, when I showed her a blueprint of the doghouse I proposed to build, she said to me, “I’m sorry, but I never could read one of those things.” “Give it to your husband or your minister to pass on to God,” I said, “and, when God finds a minute, I’m sure he’ll explain this doghouse of mine in a way that even you can understand.” She fired me. I shall never forget her. She believed that God liked people in sailboats much better than He liked people in motorboats.

> “I think you’ll find,” said Dr. Breed, “that everybody does about the same amount of thinking. Scientists simply think about things in one way, and other people think about things in others.”

> “In this country most people don’t even understand what pure research is.” “I’d appreciate it if you’d tell me what it is.” “It isn’t looking for a better cigarette filter or a softer face tissue or a longer-lasting house paint, God help us. Everybody talks about research and practically nobody in this country’s doing it. We’re one of the few companies that actually hires men to do pure research. When most other companies brag about their research, they’re talking about industrial hack technicians who wear white coats, work out of cookbooks, and dream up an improved windshield wiper for next year’s Olds-mobile.”

> I remember, shortly before Felix died, there was a Marine general who was hounding him to do something about mud.” “Mud?” “The Marines, after almost two-hundred years of wallowing in mud, were sick of it,” said Dr. Breed. “The general, as their spokesman, felt that one of the aspects of progress should be that Marines no longer had to fight in mud.” “What did the general have in mind?” “The absence of mud. No more mud.”

> “There—there really isn’t such a thing?” “I just told you there wasn’t!” cried Dr. Breed hotly. “Felix died shortly after that! And, if you’d been listening to what I’ve been trying to tell you about pure research men, you wouldn’t ask such a question! Pure research men work on what fascinates them, not on what fascinates other people.”

> “Oh, certainly. I talked to him a lot.” “Do any conversations stick in your mind?” “There was one where he bet I couldn’t tell him anything that was absolutely true. So I said to him, ‘God is love.’” “And what did he say?” “He said, ‘What is God? What is love?’” “Um.” “But God really is love, you know,” said Miss Faust, “no matter what Dr. Hoenikker said.”

Nobody can get fired, no matter what; and if somebody does accidentally make a bicycle, the union accuses us of cruel and inhuman practices and the government confiscates the bicycle for back taxes and gives it to a blind man in Afghanistan.”

> “One of the oldest games there is, cat’s cradle. Even the Eskimos know it.” “You don’t say.” “For maybe a hundred thousand years or more, grownups have been waving tangles of string in their children’s faces.” “Um.” Newt remained curled in the chair. He held out his painty hands as though a cat’s cradle were strung between them. “No wonder kids grow up crazy. A cat’s cradle is nothing but a bunch of X’s between somebody’s hands, and little kids look and look and look at all those X’s …” “And?” “No damn cat, and no damn cradle.”

> “How did he come to be an outlaw?” “It was his own idea. He asked McCabe to outlaw him and his religion, too, in order to give the religious life of the people more zest, more tang. He wrote a little poem about it, incidentally.”
