> “Why are you here, John?” she asked. I paused for a moment, “Well, I was going along and ran into some problems. When I tried to work my way around them, I ended up getting pretty lost. In the process, I just about ran out of gas and almost starved to death.”

> “Is that what you want?” she asked. I nodded. “Then I’m sure it won’t be a problem. After all, it’s closer to breakfast tomorrow than to lunch today.” I glanced at my watch. “That's an interesting way to look at it,” I said. Casey shrugged, “Sometimes it helps to look at things from a different perspective.”

> Casey paused, “It’s like this, John,” she began. “The question you saw, the one that was different—” “The one that said, ‘Why am I here?’” I interrupted. She nodded calmly, “Yes, that one. It’s not a question to be taken lightly. To glance at it is one thing. But when you go beyond glancing and actually see it, and then truly ask it of yourself—your world changes.”

> If I were being totally honest with myself, I’d admit that for years I'd been wondering if there wasn't more to life than what I already knew. It wasn’t that life was bad. Sure it was frustrating at times, particularly lately. But I had a decent job and good friends. Life was fine, even good. Still, in the back of my mind was this feeling I couldn’t quite explain. “That feeling is what inspires people to ask the question you saw,” Casey interjected.

> “Suppose someone asks themselves why they’re here, and eventually they figure out the reason….” I hesitated, “Then what?” Casey paused for a few moments, “First of all, they can do whatever they want with that knowledge. They uncovered it, and it belongs to them. They have ultimate and total say about what happens next.”

> ‘Purpose For Existing.’ We call it ‘PFE’ for short. During someone’s lifetime, they may find ten, twenty, or hundreds of things they want to do to fulfill their Purpose For Existing.

> “John, suppose you determine your Purpose For Existing is to build sports cars. And you decide you want to fulfill that PFE. What would you do?” I thought for a moment. “I suppose I’d read a lot about sports cars. Maybe I'd visit a place where they build them, or contact some people who have built them in the past and get their advice. I guess I might try to get a job where they design or assemble sports cars.” Casey nodded, “Would you stay in one place? Talk to just one person?” I paused and thought again. “No, I suppose if I really wanted to know how to build sports cars, I'd visit lots of different places and talk to lots of different people. That way I’d have a broader perspective.”

> I picked up the pen and started writing figures on the paper. Average life expectancy of seventy-eight years...twenty-two years old when I graduated college…awake sixteen hours per day...twenty minutes each day spent on mail and e-mail…. When I finished all my computing, I couldn’t believe the answer. I did the math again. Same answer. I realized Casey wasn’t kidding about the impact of the incoming waves. If from the time I graduated college until the time I was seventy-eight years old, I spent just twenty minutes per day opening and looking at mail and e-mail I didn’t really care about—that used up well over a year of my life.

Having this type of diamond, will bring you contentment. “And,” she continued, “let me tell you something very important. An even more subtle, but more powerful message is usually conveyed. Not only will those products enable you to be fulfilled if you have them, but not having them can keep you from being fulfilled.”

> “Well, back then I had what seemed like a very rational approach to life. ‘I worked all weekend,’ I’d say to myself. ‘So I deserve a treat of a new outfit, the latest electronic gadget, or some new stylish home furnishing.’” She looked at me, “The problem was, since I was always working, I rarely had time to use what I’d treated myself to. People would come over to my house and tell me how much they loved it, but I was seldom there enough to enjoy it.

> Each day I made sure I spent at least an hour doing something I really liked. Sometimes it was reading a novel I was excited about. Other days it was going for a long walk or playing sports. “Eventually, the one hour became two, and that progressed to three. Before I knew it, I was totally focused on doing what I wanted to do. Things that fulfilled my answer to⏤‘Why am I here?’”

> “You could find yourself having lived your life in a way that always fulfilled your PFE. You could spend your entire life doing what you wanted to do, because you figured out why you are here.” She paused, “But...you might reach the age of sixty-five and not have sufficient retirement savings. “What to do then?” she asked, her voice filled with mock drama. “I guess you’d just have to keep on doing what you want to do. That could indeed be tragic.”

> “Part of the reason I work, is to make money,” I began excitedly. “I need money to pay for what I buy. When I think about what those things really mean to me, I believe I’m a little bit like the people Anne and I were talking about. “It’s things to help me escape for a while. Things that help me unwind and make me feel better about my surroundings. “What I’m wondering, is how much of that would I feel the need to buy, if I didn’t have the need to ‘escape?’ Or if I didn’t need to ‘unwind’? If I was doing what I wanted to be doing, there should be less to escape from, and probably not nearly as much stress to be unwound from either.”

> Casey nodded, “Exactly. The same idea applies to people trying to figure out what their PFE is. Some find that when they experience new things and learn new ideas, certain ones resonate with them. Many people actually experience a physical reaction. “They get goosebumps, a tremor up their spine, or they cry tears of joy when they come across something they really relate to. For others, a sense of knowing comes over them. Those can all be clues to help people identify their answer to why they’re here.”
