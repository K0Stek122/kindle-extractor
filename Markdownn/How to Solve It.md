> You have to understand the problem. What is the unknown? What are the data? What is the condition?

> Thus, in countless problems, we have to ask the question: What is the unknown? We may vary the words, and ask the same thing in many different ways: What is required? What do you want to find? What are you supposed to seek?

> What is the unknown? What are the data? What is the condition? These questions are generally applicable, we can ask them with good effect dealing with all sorts of problems. Their use is not restricted to any subject-matter. Our problem may be algebraic or geometric, mathematical or nonmathematical, theoretical or practical, a serious problem or a mere puzzle; it makes no difference, the questions make sense and might help us to solve the problem.

> There is a restriction, in fact, but it has nothing to do with the subject-matter. Certain questions and suggestions of the list are applicable to “problems to find” only, not to “problems to prove.” If we have a problem of the latter kind we must use different questions; see PROBLEMS TO FIND, PROBLEMS TO PROVE.

> There are two aims which the teacher may have in view when addressing to his students a question or a suggestion of the list: First, to help the student to solve the problem at hand. Second, to develop the student’s ability so that he may solve future problems by himself.

> Solving problems is a practical skill like, let us say, swimming. We acquire any practical skill by imitation and practice. Trying to swim, you imitate what other people do with their hands and feet to keep their heads above water, and, finally, you learn to swim by practicing swimming.

> In order to group conveniently the questions and suggestions of our list, we shall distinguish four phases of the work. First, we have to understand the problem; we have to see clearly what is required. Second, we have to see how the various items are connected, how the unknown is linked to the data, in order to obtain the idea of the solution, to make a plan. Third, we carry out our plan. Fourth, we look back at the completed solution, we review and discuss it.

> If the student is lacking in understanding or in interest, it is not always his fault; the problem should be well chosen, not too difficult and not too easy, natural and interesting,
