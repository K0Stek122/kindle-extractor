> “We all have our failings, Gnaeus,” answered Auric. “Understanding one’s own is the measure of wisdom.” Lumari took a large vial filled with a muddy brown liquid from a bandolier and gave it an abrupt shake. “Dung water, from a tanner’s bating vat. A surprisingly valuable compound in several alchemical formulae. Never know what might prove useful if one is open to discovery.”

> “You are an agnostic, then,” said Lumari finally, in a matter-of-fact tone. “If you must use a word to describe me, that one works as well as another. The gods exist. This we know. We have all felt the power of Belu, for instance, when we’ve been injured or fallen ill, channeled through a priest like Sira. That is undeniable. Warrior-priests of Vanic can call upon the god and enter the Divine Fury, performing martial feats far beyond human capabilities. And I’ve seen others do amazing things, having prayed to their gods for aid. But how much do these deities involve themselves in our daily lives? How much do they care for our fates? I have no way of knowing. Thus, I place my faith in my sword and the companions beside me. I trust in them.” Auric paused, put a hand on Sira’s hands folded on the table before her. “And I count on the faith of others when the times require them.” “A rather sorry agnostic you are, then,” said Lumari.

> “I led them down into that place. I was pushing the group to accept expedition offers from the Citadel, one after another, without enough time for respite. We were all off our game. We needed rest, recuperation. We would have been more cautious if we hadn’t—” “Were they children, Auric?” Belech interrupted. “They were grown men and women, with their own wills and judgment. You weren’t their sovereign, commanding them to do this or that without their accord.”

> Belech laughed. “Just so! Lady Hannah is like you in a way. She sees value in us all, beyond the circumstances of our births, and pushes us to grow. That’s quite rare in the nobility, don’t you agree?”

> “Perdition and calamity!” exclaimed Lumari after they had gathered in a side chamber off the tabernacle. “Those priests can certainly talk. They’re worse than a gaggle of old alchemists arguing over formulae.”

> Everyone caught one or two. But old Basher, ha! With no shield to hide behind, the Korsa turned him into a pincushion! By some miracle he survived, but they had to pull ten or eleven arrows out of him, and he was awake and screaming for each one—I know, because I was one of four men holding him down while the medicus did her work. From that day forward, jolly old Basher was the world’s most fervent and humorless advocate of keeping one’s shield handy, haranguing new recruits about it, preaching to the few other two-fisted mace-men in the legion. Earned him a new nickname: Shieldmaiden of Harkeny.” Auric laughed. “My point,” Belech concluded, “is that there’s nothing as zealous and rigid as a true convert, especially when that conversion flows from a baptism involving multiple arrows piercing flesh.” “Or its emotional equivalent,”
